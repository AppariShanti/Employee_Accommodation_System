# Employee Accommodation System
This project was done as a part of Data Structures and Algorithms Course.
There is a need for an accommodation System for VNIT employees where all there data along with their accommodation type is stored. The choice for a data structure is done keeping in mind the various functionalities and other requests made by the users. For example: When an employees first joins the institute he/she should enter the details like name, identification number(in this case we consider three types of ids 1. Adhaar Number 2. Passport Number 3. Employee Number). Once the data is provided a new record is created and user is alloted accommodation based on the availabilty.In case an employee wants to change the accommodation type it can be done using the special request allocation. It can be noted that all details except the id types and id number can be updated as per user's need.
Apart from this, all the records can also be viewed and sorted as per need. A particular employee can be searched using their personal details.
This project is aimed to implement an Accommodation System for employees using various concepts of Data Structures and Program Design. It has been done in following three phases:

#### (a)  Arrays

#### (b)  Linked List

#### (c)  Trees

In each of the phases the whole system was implemented from scratch. The following functionalities are included:

1. InsertRecord - which reads a record from user. The details taken from user includes name, ID Type, ID Number, Accommmodation Type and Address.

2. removeDuplicates - to remove the duplicate entries from the records.

3. printRecords - which prints the records.

4. printSortedRecords - to print the records in alphabetic order of names without actually sorting the data in the original record.

5. search - to prints the whole information for a given Employee name.

6. deleteRecord - to delete the record of a given employee, using idtype and idnum of employee.

7. updateRecord - to update the record of an employee. The field to update is user input.

8. specialRequestAllocation - to change a type of block requested by an employee depending on the availability of that type of block.
